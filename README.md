Project Title:  World Carbon Emissions Analysis
Team Members:  Avneet Singh, Manan Wala, Terence Schultz, Kiran Sohi, Sujatha SelvarajÂ 
Project Description/Outline: Evaluate world carbon and energy consumption 
Research Questions to Answer:
Country with
Highest/Lowest Emissions
Highest/Lowest Energy Consumption
Which fuel type is being consumed by which country?
Review correlation between Consumption of Energy vs. CO2 Emissions?
GeoViews graph of Carbon Emissions and Energy Consumption
How can we predict future optimal Carbon Emissions reduction by country? 
Datasets to be Used:
